Before you are able to play, a couple of questions need to be answerd:

* "1 or 2 players?" : If you wish to play against the computer choose 1 player only.
* "Which figure you want to play with?" : In order to mark moves on the board, X or O (capital o) are available. Choose one.
* "Which figure should go first?": Once each player has a figure assigned, choose who should go first.
* Afterwards the board is displayed and players are ready to input their moves.
